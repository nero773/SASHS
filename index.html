  </h1>DESCRIPTION:<br>
A stand-alone Senior High School is a secondary educational institution that operates independently, separate from any Junior High School or Integrated School. It has its own designated campus and a distinct administrative structure, including a dedicated School Head. This contrasts with an Integrated Senior High School, which is located within an existing Junior High or Integrated School and shares its administration. </h1>
